# Write a method pretentious_primes that takes accepts an array and a number, n, as arguments. The method should return a new array where each element of the original array is replaced according to the following rules:

# when the number argument is positive, replace an element with the n-th nearest prime number that is greater than the element
# when the number argument is negative, replace an element with the n-th nearest prime number that is less than the element
# For example:

# if element = 7 and n = 1, then the new element should be 11 because 11 is the nearest prime greater than 7
# if the element = 7 and n = 2, then the new element should be 13 because 13 is the 2nd nearest prime greater than 7
# if the element = 7 and n = -1, then the new element should be 5 because 5 is the nearest prime less than 7
# if the element = 7 and n = -2, then the new element should be 3 because 3 is the 2nd nearest prime less than 7
# Note that we will always be able to find a prime that is greater than a given number because there are an infinite number of primes (this is given by Euclid's Theorem). However, we may be unable to find a prime that is smaller than a given number, because 2 is the smallest prime. When a smaller prime cannot be calculated, replace the element with nil.
